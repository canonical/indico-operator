  A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators)
  deploying and managing [Indico](https://getindico.io/) on Kubernetes. Indico is an
  open-source tool for event organisation, archival and collaboration.

  This charm simplifies initial deployment and "day N" operations of Indico
  on Kubernetes, such as scaling the number of instances, integration with SSO,
  access to S3 for redundant file storage and more. It allows for deployment on
  many different Kubernetes platforms, from [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io) to
  [Charmed Kubernetes](https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes) and public cloud Kubernetes
  offerings.

  As such, the charm makes it easy for those looking to take control of their own
  events management system whilst keeping operations simple, and gives them the
  freedom to deploy on the Kubernetes platform of their choice.

  For DevOps or SRE teams this charm will make operating Indico simple and
  straightforward through Juju's clean interface. It will allow easy deployment
  into multiple environments for testing of changes, and supports scaling out for
  enterprise deployments.
