# Indico Operator

A Juju charm deploying and managing Indico on Kubernetes. Indico is an
open-source tool for event organisation, archival and collaboration.

This charm simplifies initial deployment and "day N" operations of Indico
on Kubernetes, such as scaling the number of instances, integration with SSO,
access to S3 for redundant file storage and more. It allows for deployment on
many different Kubernetes platforms, from [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io) to
[Charmed Kubernetes](https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes) to public cloud Kubernetes
offerings.

As such, the charm makes it easy for those looking to take control of their own
events management system whilst keeping operations simple, and gives them the
freedom to deploy on the Kubernetes platform of their choice.

For DevOps or SRE teams this charm will make operating Indico simple and
straightforward through Juju's clean interface. It will allow easy deployment
into multiple environments for testing of changes, and supports scaling out for
enterprise deployments.
