# Theme customization

Indico offers a framework for customizing the look and feel of your Indico installation. See more information in [Customization](https://docs.getindico.io/en/latest/config/settings/#customization).

Once you've developed the CSS and JavaScript files you need, set the [`customization_sources_url`](https://charmhub.io/indico/configure#customization_sources_url) option of the charm to point to the repository for these.
