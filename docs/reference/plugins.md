# Plugins

Indico provides many plugins that can be used to extend functionalities without the need to change the Indico core. See more information in [Extending Indico with plugins](https://docs.getindico.io/en/latest/plugins/).

You can configure additional plugins using the [`external_plugins`](https://charmhub.io/indico/configure#external_plugins) configuration option.
