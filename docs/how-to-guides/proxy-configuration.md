This charm supports several operations that require access to external resources, such as customization or plugins installation, so your environment may not be able to reach those URLs unless through a proxy. The proxy can be configured via two configuration options `http_proxy` for HTTP requests, and `https_proxy` for HTTPS request.

Assuming Indico is already up and running as `indico`, you'll need to run the following commands:
```
juju config indico http_proxy=http://squid.example:3128
juju config indico http_proxy=http://squid.example:3128
```

For more details on the configuration options and their default values see the [configuration reference](https://charmhub.io/indico/configure).
