### Updated `nginx-prometheus-exporter` to 1.4.2 in Indico NGINX Rock

### Validated SQA CharmQA metadata.yaml based on charm behavior

Now the optional `interface` flag is properly set in the `metadata.yaml` file to reflect the actual charm's behavior.
This is part of an initiative modelling how charms should expose the metadata to Juju and the Charmhub store in order to be eligible for automated testing as part of this initiative.

### Bumped Indico version to 3.3.6 and `paypal-payment` plugin to 3.3.2

The Indico version was bumped from 3.3.1 to 3.3.6. The `paypal-payment` plugin was bumped
from 3.3 to 3.3.2 as well. As Indico released a new version with security updates, this
version bump ensures we also have the updates.
