# How to configure LDAP

To configure Indico's LDAP integration you'll have to set `ldap_host` with the URL for your LDAP server by running `juju config [charm_name] ldap_host=[value]` and `ldap_password` with its credentials `juju config [charm_name] ldap_password=[value]`.

At the moment, this feature has only been tested against Canonical's LDAP schema. If you are having any issues configuring a different LDAP instance, please, reach out to us.

For more details on the configuration options and their default values see the [configuration reference](https://charmhub.io/indico/configure).
