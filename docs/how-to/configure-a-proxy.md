# How to configure a proxy

This charm supports several operations that require access to external resources, such as customization or plugins installation, so your environment may only be able to reach those URLs through a proxy. The proxy can be configured via the [juju model configuration](https://juju.is/docs/juju/manage-models#heading--configure-a-model) by setting the [HTTP proxy keys](https://juju.is/docs/juju/list-of-model-configuration-keys).
