# How to configure a proxy

This charm supports several operations that require access to external resources, such as customization or plugins installation, so your environment may not be able to reach those URLs unless through a proxy. The proxy can be configured via the [Juju model configuration](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/howto/manage-models/#heading--configure-a-model) setting the [HTTP proxy keys](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/reference/configuration/list-of-model-configuration-keys/).
